Communicating feedback for user-initiated actions is a common pattern in Rails.
[Flash][]
Its [index.html.erb][] and [show.html.erb][] template generators include
scaffolding to render support for `notice` and `alert` messages provided by the
[ActionDispatch::Flash][] module.

All of this is made available during server-side rendering. How might we re-use
our architectural plumbing when a client-side interaction warrants a flash
message?

Appeal of client-side rendering like React:

* define HTML structure, styles, event responses in the same place in the
  codebase
  - the _content_ of the HTML's structure is either encoded _into_ the
    client-side, or re-hydrated with (JSON) data rendered server-side

* Stimulus strikes a balance in applications where HTML structure and styles are
  defined server-side
  - the `data-controller` and `data-action` definitions are determined at
    render-time on the server, and serve as a serialization format for
    client-side event listeners
  - the _content_ of the HTML is available at render-time on the server, but
    unavailable in dynamic responses to event listeners

[It all starts with HTML][].

When HTML serves as their [serialization format][], controllers and views
translate our application's state-of-the-world into a document, transmit that
document over HTTP to browsers that reconstruct it to enable end-users.

With the advent of [Stimulus Action Descriptors][] and [`<turbo-stream>`][Turbo
Stream] elements and their embedded [`<template>`][template] element content,
servers can even encode contingency plans directly into the document's elements.

**Rendering**: client-side, synchronous, immediate, Kinetic energy
**Callbacks**: client-side, asynchronous, deferred, Potential energy
**`<template>`-encoded rendering**: both server- and client-side, asynchronous, deferred, Potential energy

**Value proposition**: You have abstractions and extractions on the server-side,
re-use them to share concepts with the client-side without re-inventing parallel
versions of them.

The server encodes design decisions into the HTML in a way that's durable across
transmission and reconstruction. It controls the structure, content, and
presentation of the message, and the client controls the timing and conditions
of the message's presentation.

[Stimulus][] controllers [synchronize their state with the document's
HTML][stimulus-state] through [attribute][]-backed [Values][] and
[element][]-backed [Targets][].

Since this interaction is _only_ client-side in the browser, there's an
opportunity to do as much work as possible on the server, to the point where the
client's responsibilities are constrained, and only include appending to and
removing from the document

* co-locates decisions about structure, content, styles, and element references
  in the same server-generated template
* declarative, pre-populated state

We'll re-create an example from the [_Building Something Real_][] section of the
[Stimulus Handbook][]. To start, we'll enhance a button to copy an invitation
code to the end-user's clipboard. Next, we'll display a server-rendered alert
message to notify the end-user that they've copied the code. Finally, through
the passage of time, we'll dismiss the alert. Our implementation won't depend on
[XMLHttpRequest][], [fetch][], or any client-side templating.

The interaction will be entirely self-contained. The context encoded directly
into the `<button>` element's attributes and content will guide the behavior.

## Our starting point

`InvitationCodesController#show` serves as our only route. The `#show` action
assigns the value of `params[:id]` into the `@invitation_code` instance
variable. For example, a [`GET
http://localhost:3000/invitation_codes/abc123`][GET-abc123] request would assign
`@invitation_code = "abc123"`:

[GET-abc123]: http://localhost:3000/invitation_codes/abc123

```ruby
# app/controllers/invitation_codes_controller.rb

class InvitationCodesController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @invitation_code = params[:id]
  end
end
```

A more production-ready version might read an invitation code from the database,
or generate one on-the-fly.

The `app/views/invitation_codes/show.html.erb` template renders two `<fieldset>`
elements: the first presents an [`<input readonly>`][input-readonly] to copy the
invitation code out of, and the second presents an `<input>` to paste the code
into:

[input-readonly]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly

```erb
<%# app/views/invitation_codes/show.html.erb %>

<fieldset>
  <legend>Copy</legend>

  <label>
    Invitation code

    <input value="<%= @invitation_code %>" readonly>
  </label>

  <button type="button" value="<%= @invitation_code %>"
          data-controller="clipboard"
          data-action="click->clipboard#copy">
    Copy to clipboard
  </button>
</fieldset>

<fieldset>
  <legend>Paste</legend>

  <label>
    Invitation code
    <input>
  </label>
</fieldset>

<div id="alerts" class="absolute bottom-0 right-0 w-96"></div>
```

Since we'll be notifying end-user that they've copied the code to their
clipboard, we'll need somewhere to push those messages. We'll render a `<div>`
element at the bottom of the file and mark it with [id="alerts"][id-attr].

[id-attr]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id

The first `<fieldset>` pairs the pre-populated `<input>` element with a
[`<button type="button">`][type="button"] element. The `<button>` [routes
`click` events][stimulus-actions] to a `clipboard` [controller][]. Like
_Building Something Real_'s [`clipboard` controller][example-controller], ours
calls [`navigator.clipboard.writeText`][writeText]:

[type="button"]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#attr-type

[writeText]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/writeText

```javascript
// app/javascript/controllers/clipboard_controller.js

import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  copy({ target: { value } }) {
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(value)
  }
}
```

## Appending alerts

Our server will pre-populate the alert at server render-time:

```html
<div role="alert" class="bg-white border border-solid rounded-md m-4 p-4">
  Copied to clipboard
</div>
```

First, we'll we'll nest a `<template>` element within the `<button
type="button">` element:

```diff
--- a/app/views/invitation_codes/show.html.erb
+++ b/app/views/invitation_codes/show.html.erb
  <button type="button" value="<%= @invitation_code %>"
          data-controller="clipboard"
          data-action="click->clipboard#copy">
    Copy to clipboard
+
+   <template>
+   </template>
  </button>
```

Then, within the `<template>` element, we'll render `"Copied to clipboard"` as
alert lightly styled to resemble a [toast message][toast]:

[toast]: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/toasts/

```diff
--- a/app/views/invitation_codes/show.html.erb
+++ b/app/views/invitation_codes/show.html.erb
  <button type="button" value="<%= @invitation_code %>"
          data-controller="clipboard"
          data-action="click->clipboard#copy">
    Copy to clipboard

    <template>
+     <div role="alert" class="bg-white border border-solid rounded-md m-4 p-4">
+       Copied to clipboard
+     </div>
    </template>
  </button>
```

On its own, a `<template>` element is completely inert, and its contents are not
rendered.

We'll treat the outer `<template>` element as a `clone` target by marking it
with the `[data-clone-target="source"]` attribute. We'll route `click` events
dispatched by the `<button>` to a `clone#append` action that [appends][] the
`<template>` contents to the document. We'll mark the `<button>` with
`[data-clone-destination-value="alerts"]` to encode _which_ element to
append its contents to. The `"alerts"` value directs the `clone#append` action
to append the `<template data-clone-target="source">` element's contents into
the page's `<div id="alerts">`:

[appends]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/append

```diff
--- a/app/views/invitation_codes/show.html.erb
+++ b/app/views/invitation_codes/show.html.erb
  <button type="button" value="<%= @invitation_code %>"
-          data-controller="clipboard"
+          data-controller="clipboard clone"
+          data-clone-destination-value="alerts"
-          data-action="click->clipboard#copy">
+          data-action="click->clipboard#copy click->clone#append">
    Copy to clipboard

-   <template>
+   <template data-clone-target="source">
      <div role="alert" class="bg-white border border-solid rounded-md m-4 p-4">
        Copied to clipboard
      </div>
    </template>
  </button>
```

With our server-generated content in-place, we'll introduce the `clone`
controller. It acts upon the `<template>` elements that it references through
its [`sourceTargets` property][stimulus-target]. The `clone#append` action
iterates through that collection, [clones][cloneNode] each element's
[content][template-content] fragment, and appends that content fragment to the
document:

[template-content]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTemplateElement/content
[cloneNode]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/cloneNode
[stimulus-target]: https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/reference/targets

```javascript
// app/javascript/controllers/clone_controller.js

import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  static targets = [ "source" ]
  static values = { destination: String }

  append() {
    const destination = document.getElementById(this.destinationValue)

    for (const { content } of this.sourceTargets) {
      destination.append(content.cloneNode(true))
    }
  }
}
```

The `clone#append` references the collection of `<template>` elements through
its the **plural** `this.sourceTargets` property. In our example's case,
there's a single element marked with `[data-clone-target="source"]`, so direct
access through the **singular** `this.sourceTarget` could suffice. Access to
singular references should guard against missing
`[data-clone-target="source"]` targets through the [**existential**
`this.hasSourceTarget` property][target properties]. Looping over the
collection of targets supports **both** scenarios **without** any conditionals,
and bakes-in future-proofed support for acting upon multiple embedded
`<template>` targets.

### Appending alerts with Turbo Streams

Since `<turbo-stream>` elements embed `<template>` elements of their own,
they're inert until they're [connected to the document][]. Similarly, browsers
omit the contents of `<template>` elements during rendering. By embedded a
`<turbo-stream>` element _into_ a `<template>` element, we're able to transform
the `<turbo-stream>` element's typically [kinetic energy][] into a [potential
energy][] of sorts.

```diff
--- a/app/views/invitation_codes/show.html.erb
+++ b/app/views/invitation_codes/show.html.erb
   <button type="button" value="<%= @invitation_code %>"
           data-controller="clipboard clone"
           data-clone-destination-value="alerts"
           data-action="click->clipboard#copy click->clone#append">
     Copy to clipboard

     <template data-clone-target="source">
+      <turbo-stream>
+        <template>
           <div role="alert" class="bg-white border border-solid rounded-md m-4 p-4">
             Copied to clipboard
           </div>
+        </template>
+      </turbo-stream>
     </template>
   </button>
 </fieldset>
```

The `clone` controller's reference to the `<div id="alerts">` element through
its `[data-clone-destination-value="alerts"]` attribute re-implements one
of a Turbo Stream's core capabilities: the `[target]` attribute.

A `<turbo-stream>` element's `[target]` attribute encodes a reference to another
element's `[id]` attribute elsewhere in the document. When `<turbo-stream>`
elements [connect][StreamElement.connectedCallback] to the document, they
execute their operation and [disconnect][StreamElement.disconnect] themselves.

It's not important which element we append the contents of the `<template
data-clone-target="source">` element. The `clone#append` action appends the
element to the [Event.target][] (in our case, the `<button>` element).

+    const destination = event.target

     for (const { content } of this.sourceTargets) {
       destination.append(content.cloneNode(true))
     }

We'll treat the outer `<template>` element as a `clone` target by marking it
with the `[data-clone-target="source"]` attribute, and we'll route `click`
events to a `clone` controller to [append][] the `<template>` element's contents
to the document whenever the `<button>` element is clicked:

## Wrapping up

Experiment with this code in a [JSFiddle][]

[JSFiddle]: https://jsfiddle.net/8amowgL4/1/

As an exercise for the reader, imagine the implications of this pattern in other
contexts. For example, adding an email address from a [combobox][]-powered list
of recipients, or removing a `<fieldset>` element of controls from a dynamic
form.

Included:

* an entirely client-side interaction augmented by server-generated HTML
* declaratively encoded DOM operations through `<template>` and `<turbo-stream>`
  elements
* three general purpose controllers with potential for re-use across the
  codebase

Excluded:

* parallel alert implementations split across the client-server boundary
* transforming JSON into HTML
* `XMLHttpRequest`, `fetch`
